# nvdla_exploration

This repo is NVDLA for low precision exploration. I will try to add more test.

# Outline

* Vistualization model
    * Yolo Object Detection (Caffe)
    * Cifar10 Quick every layer vistualization (Caffe)
* Caffe result and NVDLA result compare
    * Cifar10 Quick first convolution feature maps (Random sample 42 test/train images)
    * Cifar10 Quick prediction results (Random sample 42 test/train images)
* Others
    * Read image mean subtraction by pixel vistaulization
